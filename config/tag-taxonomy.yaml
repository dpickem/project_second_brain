# config/tag-taxonomy.yaml
#
# PURPOSE: Curated baseline taxonomy for the Second Brain system
#
# This file defines the PREDEFINED tags in the Second Brain system.
# The meta/tag-taxonomy.md file in the vault is AUTO-GENERATED from this.
#
# =============================================================================
# ARCHITECTURE: Two-Tier Tag System
# =============================================================================
#
# This YAML file is the CURATED BASELINE - a versioned, hand-picked taxonomy.
# The database Tag table is the LIVE STATE - includes YAML tags + auto-created.
#
# Flow:
#   1. YAML → DB: TagService.sync_taxonomy_to_db() syncs predefined tags
#   2. Auto-create: When exercises are generated for topics from the knowledge
#      graph, missing tags are auto-created in the DB (not in this file)
#   3. No DB → YAML: Auto-created tags stay in DB only, keeping this file clean
#
# Why this design?
#   - This file stays curated and version-controlled
#   - Users can add content on any topic; tags are created automatically
#   - The knowledge graph drives topic discovery, not this static file
#   - To see all tags (including auto-created): query the database Tag table
#
# =============================================================================
#
# TAG HIERARCHY: domain/category/topic (up to 3 levels)
#
# TO ADD PREDEFINED TAGS:
# 1. Edit this file
# 2. Run: python scripts/setup/setup_vault.py --regenerate-taxonomy
# 3. The vault's meta/tag-taxonomy.md will be updated
# 4. Run TagService.sync_taxonomy_to_db() to sync to database
